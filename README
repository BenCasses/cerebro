Cerebro is a collection of tools and libraries for dynamically
monitoring a cluster of nodes.

This project as been named Cerebro to pay homage to the the Ganglia
project (http://ganglia.sourceforge.net).  A heavily modified version
of Ganglia was once used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to
support our Linux clusters. 

Over time, the gmond daemon was "hacked" to support a number of local
performance enhancements and features.  A number of features desired
by users, system administrators, and other developers could not be
added to Ganglia without significant architectural changes.

Since a large part of the Ganglia package was already removed from our
local package, it was apparent that an internally developed monitoring
tool was needed.  To pay homage to Ganglia, another member of the
central nervous system was chosen for this project's name.

It is only coincidence that another famous monitoring tool/machine is
also named Cerebro.  Cerebro was the best name I could find.  I
refused to name this project dendrite or axon :-)
