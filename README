Cerebro is a collection of tools and libraries for dynamically
monitoring a cluster of nodes.

This project as been named Cerebro to pay homage to the the Ganglia
project (http://ganglia.sourceforge.net).  A heavily modified version
of Ganglia was once used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on
our Linux clusters.  Originally, a Ganglia gmond daemon with all
metrics removed except for the heartbeat message was used as an aid
for a cluster node up/down detection utility.

Over time, the gmond daemon was "hacked" to support a number of other
features.  However, a number of features desired by users, system
administrators, and other developers could not be added to Ganglia
without significant architectural changes.

Since so much of the Ganglia package was already removed from our
local package, it was apparent that an internally developed monitoring
tool was needed.  To pay homage to Ganglia, another member of the
central nervous system was chosen for this project's name.

It is only coincidence that another famous monitoring tool/machine is
also named Cerebro.  Cerebro was the best name I could find.  I
refused to name this project dendrite or axon :-)
