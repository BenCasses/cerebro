Cerebro is a collection of tools for dynamically monitoring a cluster
of nodes.

The name of this project comes from its origins in the Ganglia project
(http://ganglia.sourceforge.net).  A modified version of Ganglia was
originally used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to
dynamically monitor a system.  Over time, it became necessary to write
our own dynamic monitoring tool.  To pay homage to Ganglia, another
member of the central nervous system was chosen for the name.
