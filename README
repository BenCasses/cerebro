Cerebro is a collection of cluster monitoring tools and libraries.
This project as been named after a part of the central nervous system
to pay homage to the the Ganglia project
(http://ganglia.sourceforge.net).  A heavily modified version of
Ganglia was once used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to
support a number of features on our Linux clusters.  However, 
it later became necessary to develop a slightly different project.

The Cerebro project provides:

- No need to modify code to monitor new metrics
- A dynamic module, library, and command line interfaces that allows
  new metrics to be monitored without any software updates.

The Cerebro project should not be mistaken as a host monitoring system
like Ganglia or Supermon.  The goal of Cerebro was to provide a simple
scalable tool to propogate a small amount of monitoring information
across a cluster.  The tool is particularly useful for debugging on a
cluster, where a new metric needs to be temporarly monitored.
