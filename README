Cerebro is a collection of cluster monitoring tools and libraries.
This project has been named after a part of the central nervous system
to pay homage to the the Ganglia project
(http://ganglia.sourceforge.net).  A heavily modified version of
Ganglia was once used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to
support a number of features on our Linux clusters.  As the needs and
demands of Ganglia changed, it became necessary to develop a slightly
different project.

The Cerebro project provides:

- No need to modify code to monitor new metrics
- A dynamic module, library, and command line interface that allows
  new metrics to be monitored without any software updates.
- A dynamic module interface that allows for easy configuration
  across an entire cluster.
- A dynamic module interface that allows the software to have knowledge
  of what each node in the cluster should be.

The Cerebro project should not be mistaken as a host monitoring system
like Ganglia or Supermon.  The goal of Cerebro was to provide a
simple, scalable tool with a wide range of user interfaces so that it
would be easy to gather, propogate, and retrieve new monitoring
information across a cluster.
