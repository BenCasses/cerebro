Cerebro is a collection of tools and libraries for monitoring a
cluster of nodes.

This project as been named Cerebro to pay homage to the the Ganglia
project (http://ganglia.sourceforge.net).  A heavily modified version
of Ganglia was once used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to
support our Linux clusters. Over time, it was apparent that an
internally developed monitoring tool was needed instead of this
heavily modified Ganglia.  To pay homage to Ganglia, another member of
the central nervous system was chosen for this project's name.

It is only coincidence that another famous monitoring tool/machine is
also named Cerebro.  Cerebro was the best name I could find.  I
refused to name this project dendrite or axon :-)
