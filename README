Cerebro is a collection of cluster monitoring tools and libraries.
This project as been named after a part of the central nervous system
to pay homage to the the Ganglia project
(http://ganglia.sourceforge.net).  A heavily modified version of
Ganglia was once used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to
support our Linux clusters. Over time, it was apparent that an
internally developed monitoring tool was needed instead of a heavily
modified Ganglia.

- things made better
   - not sleep(1)
   - not need to modify code to monitor new things
   - with library interface rather than gmetric
   - and module interface
