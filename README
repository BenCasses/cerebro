Cerebro is a collection of cluster monitoring tools and libraries.
This project has been named after a part of the central nervous system
to pay homage to the the Ganglia project
(http://ganglia.sourceforge.net).  

A heavily modified version of Ganglia was once used at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, but as needs and demands changed, it
became necessary to develop a slightly different tool.

The goal of Cerebro was to provide:
- A light cluster monitoring utility with less CPU interruption.

- A set of libraries, tools, a dynamic module interface that allow
users to monitor new metrics without any compilation or configuration
changes.

- A dynamic module interface which allows the libraries and tools to
have knowledge of every cluster node and allow for automatic
configuration across a cluster.

- A dynamic module interface that allows for individual clusters to
monitor different metrics based solely on the modules installed.

At this point in time, the Cerebro project should not be mistaken for
a full host monitoring system like Ganglia or Supermon, although it
one day may be.  Several other ideas and concepts that were
anticipated to go into the first release of Cerebro have been delayed
to future releases.  (i.e. Version one didn't accomplish 100% of the
goals and ideas I had, such is life :-) A list of future features are
listed in the TODO.
