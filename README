Cerebro is a collection of cluster monitoring tools and libraries.
This project as been named after a part of the central nervous system
to pay homage to the the Ganglia project
(http://ganglia.sourceforge.net).  A heavily modified version of
Ganglia was once used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to
support a number of small features on our Linux clusters. 

Over time, it became more and more difficult to support a heavily
modified Ganglia, so the Cerebro project was born.  The Cerebro
project provides:

- Less CPU interruption
- No need to modify code to monitor new metrics
- A C API to send and retrieve metric data
- A dynamic module interface that allows new metrics to be added into
  a cluster without any software updates.

The Cerebro project should not be mistaken as a host monitoring system
like Ganglia or Supermon.  The goal of Cerebro was to provide a simple
scalable tool to propogate a small amount of monitoring information
across a cluster.  The tool is particularly useful for debugging on a
cluster, where a new metric needs to be temporarly monitored.
