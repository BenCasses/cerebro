Portability
- IPv6
- Multicast

Future Features
- controller
  - allow access through netowrk?
  - limit host connections based on host list or subnet
  - user/password limited access?
  - munge based access?

- controller/access rights
  - need some security stuff

- listener
  - limit data receiving based on host list or subnet
  - allow mixed listening
    i.e. accept heartbeats from nodes in genders database and
         nodes on a specific subnet. Would be useful for BGL.

- Malloc looping
  - so can try to avoid dieing on low memory conditions
    (i.e. before the linux oom killer finishes its job)

- iterate through all config modules, exit after one succeeds.  If
  none succeed, use default.

Enhancements
- Should pass config to modules so they can configure/setup 
  based on various conditions.
- need way to send functions/pointers/etc. stuff between modules
  without keeping on adding functions.
- logging/error output/something facility for modules

Module Extra Stuff
- signal or polling to see if there are new modules to load
- retry loading of previously failed modules
  - metric
  - monitoring
  - event
- don't fail if mysql connection fails in monitoring modules

TCP connections instead of UDP for metric monitoring
 
Specs:
- cerebro.spec.in - find better way to do restarts
