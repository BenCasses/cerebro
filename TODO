Design
- Ability to flush metric from listener
  - requires protocol change, listener must also know metric origin?
  - Check for root in lib?
  - will require protocol headers to be hidden?
  - password or something for userspace metrics?
- Way for metric modules to tell Cerebrod it has new data and it should
  be sent out??
  - pass a function to the thread to be called with a metric_name.
  - will tell cerebrod this thing has been updated.
- Update time for each cerebro metric data?
- nodelist
  - use own list instead of 'List' to store iterators?
- strerror_r and errormsg_r funcs
- generic err message buffer in cerebro_t handle, i.e for conffile errors
- use tables instead of lists in speaker_data to sort faster
