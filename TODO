Documention
- cerebro.1 manpage

Portability
- IPv6
- Multicast

Cleanup
- cerebrod metric_list into a new file or something? 
  - hard to follow, especially destroy stuff
  - atleast a common create func?
- abstract listener_data a bit more?  
- restart metric - not the right word?
- passthrough code cleanup

Design
- cerebro-admin
- Ability to flush metric from listener
  - requires protocol change, listener must also know metric origin
- password or something for userspace metrics?
- Way for metric modules to tell Cerebrod it has new data and it should
  be sent out??
  - pass a function to the thread to be called with a metric_name.
  - will tell cerebrod this thing has been updated.
  - redo metric_period logic
    - -1 never
    - 0 all the time
    - > 0 ...
    - ??
  - max period allowed too?
- Update time for each cerebro metric data?
- nodelist
  - use own list instead of 'List' to store iterators?
- strerror_r and errormsg_r funcs
- generic err message buffer in cerebro_t handle, i.e for conffile errors
- use tables instead of lists in speaker_data to sort faster

Before distribution
- devel package?
- untabify
- default installed cerebro.conf w/ instructions/examples

GPL
- do it
- place header on all headers
- place on all c files
- note on manpage ORIGINS
