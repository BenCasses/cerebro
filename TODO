Documention
- cerebro.1 manpage

Testing
- fd leaking
- mem-leaking

Cleanup
- cleanup common hash into "data" and put in data.c??
- rename _LEN req/res defines, b/c its about buffer lenghts, not length
  of the struct??

Audit
- code review to reduce memory footprint

Portability
- IPv6
- Non-pthreads support

Design
- metric modules
  - modules for starttime/boottime
- nodelist
  - use own list instead of 'List' to store iterators?
- metric retrieval flags
    - if_up 
    - if not exist in node do default?
    - metric timeout length ability with metric up/down
- metric with value of arbitrary data
  - will require len field to heartbeat packets and metric data
  - will require magic field to ensure packets are in-sync??
- allow variable arguments for get_nodes 
- check if metric name exists in list/hash rather than hard coded
- gendersllnl config, up listening threads dependent on cluster size
  i.e. 4 threads for mcr/thunder size clusters?
- how remove metric data?
- strerror_r and errormsg_r funcs
- libcerebro set configfile, module, etc. functions
- generic err message buffer in cerebro_t handle, i.e for conffile errors
- config_is_setup and and equivalent functions
- pthreads locking for clusterlists/config modules?? (they are read only)

Before distribution
- devel package?

Debugging
- signals to daemon to log/unlog debug info?

GPL
- do it
- place header on all headers
- place on all c files
- note on manpage ORIGINS

Before public release
- untabify

Misc
- remove hash/list buffering in list.c hash.c?
