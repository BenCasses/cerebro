Documention
- cerebro.1 manpage

Testing
- fd leaking
- mem-leaking
- api again

Cleanup
- common version check code
- merge metric_names and metric_data stuff better after new version unmarshall/check code inserted
- common receive data func?
- no need to malloc values in heartbeats and destroy em??
- packet buflen max len issue with number of metrics supportable
  - base on metric_max
- string length issue with packet buflen fixed in listener
- check version earlier during unmarshalling, otherwise who knows what
data you're unmarshalling.
   - only need to do in cerebro metric_data now

Audit
- code review to reduce memory footprint

Portability
- IPv6
- Non-pthreads support

Design
- Update time for each cerebro metric data?
- ability for data to be stored/not-stored in the internal hash
  i.e. passed directly to module and forgotten
- nodelist
  - use own list instead of 'List' to store iterators?
- how remove metric data?
  - Behlendo Request: Way to force most up to date data
  - Will require speaker to listen for "control" packets.
- strerror_r and errormsg_r funcs
- generic err message buffer in cerebro_t handle, i.e for conffile errors

Before distribution
- devel package?

GPL
- do it
- place header on all headers
- place on all c files
- note on manpage ORIGINS

Before public release
- untabify

Misc
- remove hash/list buffering in list.c hash.c?
