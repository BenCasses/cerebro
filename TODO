  - Will require speaker to listen for "control" packets.
- strerror_r and errormsg_r funcs
- libcerebro set configfile, module, etc. functions
- generic err message buffer in cerebro_t handle, i.e for conffile errors
- pthreads locking for clusterlists/config modules?? (they are read only)
- service up/down detection
