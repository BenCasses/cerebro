Documention
- cerebro.1 manpage

Testing
- all protocol error conditions
- fd leaking
- mem-leaking

Cleanup
- cleanup common hash into "data" and put in data.c??
- 'get' configuration routines?
- common heartbeat destroy?
  - for speaker/listerner
- conffile lib - unsigned int?
  - cleanup int vs. unsigned in configs
- lower resident memory size by using more mallocs rather than buffers.
- unsigned_int32 vs. u_int32

Audit
- code review to reduce memory footprint

Portability
- IPv6
- Non-pthreads support

Design
- ability for data to be stored/not-stored in the internal hash
- Data structure for list/index combination?
- Move pthread_lock in cerebro_error to error lib??
- wrappers err_init stuff, how fix?
- metric to get available metrics
- make cerebro calls pthread safe??
- raw metric_data type
- metric modules
  - modules for starttime/boottime
- nodelist
  - use own list instead of 'List' to store iterators?
- how remove metric data?
- strerror_r and errormsg_r funcs
- libcerebro set configfile, module, etc. functions
- generic err message buffer in cerebro_t handle, i.e for conffile errors
- config_is_setup and and equivalent functions
- pthreads locking for clusterlists/config modules?? (they are read only)

Before distribution
- devel package?

GPL
- do it
- place header on all headers
- place on all c files
- note on manpage ORIGINS

Before public release
- untabify

Misc
- remove hash/list buffering in list.c hash.c?
