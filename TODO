Documention
- cerebro.1 manpage

Testing
- fd leaking
- mem-leaking
- api again

Cleanup
- metric value receive in libcerebro metric_data
- cerebrod metric_list into a new file or something? 
  - hard to follow, especially destroy stuff
  - atleast a common create func?
- abstract listener_data a bit more?  
- metric value marshall/unmarshall common funcs??
- receive metric_value common funcs?
- libcerebro control stuff
- manpages for libcerebro control stuff
- cerebro-admin

Portability
- IPv6
- Non-pthreads support
- Multicast

Design
- Way for metric modules to tell Cerebrod it has new data and it should
  be sent out??
  - pass a function to the thread to be called with a metric_name.
  - will tell cerebrod this thing has been updated.
  - redo metric_period logic
    - -1 never
    - 0 all the time
    - > 0 ...
    - ??
- Update time for each cerebro metric data?
- ability for data to be stored/not-stored in the internal hash
  i.e. passed directly to module and forgotten
- nodelist
  - use own list instead of 'List' to store iterators?
- how remove metric data?
  - Behlendo Request: Way to force most up to date data
  - Will require speaker to listen for "control" packets.
    - should be multicast?
- strerror_r and errormsg_r funcs
- generic err message buffer in cerebro_t handle, i.e for conffile errors
- use tables instead of lists in speaker_data to sort faster
- speaker controller - flush (can read multicast packets)
- listener controller - clean remove/unhash (can read multicast packets)
- metric controller - unregister/register/update (local only)

Before distribution
- devel package?
- untabify
= default installed cerebro.conf w/ instructions/examples

GPL
- do it
- place header on all headers
- place on all c files
- note on manpage ORIGINS

Misc
- remove hash/list buffering in list.c hash.c?
