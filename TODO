Cleanup

Future Features
- controller
  - allow access through netowrk
  - limit host connections based on host list or subnet
  - user/password limited access?
  - munge based access?

- controller/access rights
  - need some security stuff

- listener
  - limit data receiving based on host list or subnet
  - allow listening to multiple subnets/networks/ips/multciasts?
  - allow mixed listening
    i.e. accept heartbeats from nodes in genders database and
         nodes on a specific subnet. Would be useful for BGL.

- event based monitoring

- Malloc looping
  - so can try to avoid dieing on low memory conditions
    (i.e. before the linux oom killer finishes its job)

Enhancements
- Should pass config to modules so they can configure/setup 
  based on various conditions.
- method for metric modules to send heartbeats by themselves when
  they need to.
- need way to send functions/pointers/etc. stuff between modules
  without keeping on adding functions.
- logging/error output/something facility for modules
- Fix modules loading so that max metrics config isn't required.
