TODO 

documentation
- flags stuff in metric modules
- metric module "_is_updated" not in thread anymore
- data need not be propogated only by heartbeat
- metric module period > 0 for non-heartbeat

general cleanup of code

Before Release
- up age/lib stuff in configure.ac

Portability
- IPv6
- Multicast

Future Features
- controller
  - allow access through netowrk
  - limit host connections based on host list or subnet
  - user/password limited access?
  - munge based access?

- controller/access rights
  - need some security stuff

- listener
  - limit data receiving based on host list or subnet
  - allow mixed listening
    i.e. accept heartbeats from nodes in genders database and
         nodes on a specific subnet. Would be useful for BGL.

- Malloc looping
  - so can try to avoid dieing on low memory conditions
    (i.e. before the linux oom killer finishes its job)

- speaker
  - metrics can be per heartbeat or not
    - specified via modules/controller

Enhancements
- Should pass config to modules so they can configure/setup 
  based on various conditions.
- method for metric modules to send heartbeats by themselves when
  they need to.
- need way to send functions/pointers/etc. stuff between modules
  without keeping on adding functions.
- logging/error output/something facility for modules
