Documention
- cerebro.1 manpage

Testing
- fd leaking
- mem-leaking

Cleanup
- common code for looping servers??
- common code for various server code
- metric_type data conversion thingie
- cleanup common hash into "data" and put in data.c??

Audit
- code review to reduce memory footprint

Portability
- IPv6
- Non-pthreads support

Design/Re-Code
- How user get list of all nodes?
- only one load function for libcerebro?
- default timeout_len configurable in config file
  - necessary for event based up/down
- list interface w/ iterators count, foreach, find, etc.
  - and type func??
- merge server datas into one hash??
- merge servers into one server??
- gendersllnl config, up listening threads dependent on cluster size
  i.e. 4 threads for mcr/thunder size clusters?
- support float/double/string for metric monitoring
- how remove metric data?
- need list for updown server??
- move listener hash into metric hash 
- strerror_r and errormsg_r funcs
- libcerebro set configfile, module, etc. functions
- generic err message in cerebro_t handle, i.e for conffile errors
- config_is_setup and and equivalent functions
- pthreads locking for clusterlists/config modules?? (they are read only)

Before distribution
- devel package?

Debugging
- signals to daemon to log/unlog debug info?

GPL
- do it
- place header on all headers
- place on all c files
- note on manpage ORIGINS

Before public release
- untabify

Misc
- remove hash/list buffering in list.c hash.c?
