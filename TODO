Portability
- IPv6
- Multicast

Cleanup
- passthrough code cleanup

Design
- Ability to flush metric from listener
  - requires protocol change, listener must also know metric origin?
  - Check for root in lib?
  - will require protocol headers to be hidden?
  - password or something for userspace metrics?
