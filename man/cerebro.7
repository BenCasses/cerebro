.SH "NAME"
cerebro \- cluster monitoring tools and libraries
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Cerebro
is a collection of monitoring tools and libraries.  It is made up of a
daemon, loadable modules, a library, and several tools.

The daemon, 
.B cerebrod(8),
is the core of
.B Cerebro.
Typically executed on every node of a cluster, it is responsible for
sending, receiving, and monitoring various metric data.  

The metric data that 
.B cerebrod(8)
sends and receives is dependent on the data configured for monitoring.
Data can be sent via modules developed for
.B cerebrod,
(See 
.B cerebro_modules(3)
for more information on these modules.), data fed into the daemon
using 
.B libcerebro(3),
or data fed into the daemon via 
.B cerebro-admin.

.B Libcerebro
and 
.B cerebro-admin
offer the user the ability to send data by programming them into tools
and/or scripts.  Modules developed for 
.B cerebrod,
will be automatically loaded by the daemon and those specific metrics
will automatically be monitored.

.B Libcerebro
and
.B cerebro-stat
offer the user the ability to receive data and program them into tools
and/or scripts.

Before
.B cerebro
can be used as a whole it must be configured.  
See
.B cerebro.conf(5)
for a complete list and description of configuration file options and
general configuration information.  A configuration module is also
available for use with
.B cerebrod.
If your orgnization already has a database or configuration system for
clusters, the configuration module may allow your orgnization to 
configure 
.B cerebrod
off that database instead.

Three other module types are available for use in 
.B cerebrod.
 'clusterlist' modules define what nodes exist within a cluster.
 'monitor' modules allow specific metrics to be passed to the 
module for handling, perhaps for logging purposes.
 'event' modules allow for the creation of events when certain
metric information is received.
See 
.B cerebro_modules(3)
for more details.

An event notification API is provided with 
.B libcerebro
for programming against these events.
